# Star Match Game

----------

This is my first React app.  90% of the code and concepts came from a PluralSight "React: Getting Started" course by Samer Buna.  [https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents "https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents")

This app is an attempt to integrate the code and concepts from the mentioned course into a self-deploying web app hosted in MS Azure (.NET Core and React.js).

The demo app can be seen at:
